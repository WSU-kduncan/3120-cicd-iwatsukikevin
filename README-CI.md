# CI Project Overview
- The purpose of this project is to learn how to use a set of platforms called Docker to create software containers. These containers package code so that applications run efficiently across computing environments which makes practicing them worthwhile. For this project, we will be using docker commands on Linux command consoles, a GitHub repository unique for this project, and a computer app called "Docker Desktop".
